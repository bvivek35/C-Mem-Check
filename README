This is a simple memory checking module for C.
This will help in detecting memory leaks, double free and freeing unallocated pointers.

NOTE : This will run on unix. I cannot promise support for windows.

To Use :

1) setup the required folders using the configure script
	use :
		./configure.sh

2) compile the library(static lib now)
	use :
		make lib
3) add the my_mem_check.h file with a include preprocessor directive to your sources.

4) compile your sources.
	use the libdetect.a while linking(-ldetect)
	donot forget to provide the library path during linking !	

5) the report will be printed at the terminal after the program finishes execution.

I hope someone will find this useful...
